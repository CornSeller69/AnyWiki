<h3>How to download: For dummies</h3>
1. Download AnyWiki.zip,
2. Take everything out of the .zip,
3. Remove /Pics folder aswell as README.md, LICENSE and *this* INSTALL-GUIDE.md since all of this is shit you dont need,
4. Take everything out of /Actual-stuff folder, then from /HTML-Stuff folder and then everything from /JavaScript-Stuff and /CSS-Stuff,
5. Overall, all files should just be in same place :P
6. Enjoy your poorly made wiki :trollface:
<h5>That's it, yup. That is all you need for it to work... heheheh... "properly"...</h5>
