<h3>How to download: For dummies</h3>
1. Download AnyWiki.zip,<br>
2. Take everything out of the .zip,<br>
3. Remove /Pics folder aswell as README.md, LICENSE and *this* INSTALL-GUIDE.md since all of this is shit you dont need,<br>
4. Take everything out of /Download This You Moron folder (or keep it inside, your call)<br>
5. Overall, all files should just be in same place (Except of what is in GitHub-Couldnt_haul..blahBlah folder, it MUST stay where it is!!!:P<br>
6. Enjoy your poorly made wiki :trollface:<br>
<h5>That's it, yup. That is all you need for it to work... heheheh... "properly"...</h5>
