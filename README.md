# AnyWiki
<h3>What is AnyWiki?</h3>
AnyWiki is a simple Wikipedia-like project made in HTML. The premise is that it's a cheaper knock-off of Wikipedia pretty much, where since it won't be public website or anything it's going to be lawless.
<h3>Deadline</h3>
Deadline before I'm forced to bring the project to completion is May 20th 2024. (If I wont make it on time, Im fucked, haha).
<h3>Language</h3>
Simple, it's in polish. But why? Because I'm polish duh. Also It's a school project so y'know...
