# AnyWiki
<h3>What is AnyWiki?</h3>
AnyWiki is a simple Wikipedia-like project made in HTML. The premise is that it's a cheaper knock-off of Wikipedia pretty much, where since it won't be public website or anything it's going to be lawless.
<h3>Deadline</h3>
Deadline is 20th May, however check the newest tab in README.md!!!!
<h3>Language</h3>
Simple, it's in polish. But why? Because I'm polish duh. Also It's a school project so y'know...
<h3>Release?</h3>
I'm very confident to say that AnyWiki **might be ready for release**! While some limitations dissapointed me to the very point I still believe this project overall turned out nicely. Time to do other projects now, next will be my Simplistic Tic Tac Toe game!
